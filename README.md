## Introduction

I'm building a custom Redis to deepen my understanding of systems programming, low-latency data structures, and networked services. Redis is widely used in real-world applications for its speed and efficiency, and reimplementing it gives me hands-on experience with event-driven I/O, serialization, memory management, and TCP networking. This project pushes me to think critically about performance trade-offs, data persistence, and concurrency, all of which are essential skills for backend and infrastructure engineeringâ€”especially in high-performance environments like trading systems or distributed systems platforms.

## Known issues and limitations

In this section, summarize any notable issues and/or limitations of your software. If none are known yet, this section can be omitted (and don't forget to remove the corresponding entry in the [Table of Contents](#table-of-contents) too); alternatively, you can leave this section in place and write something along the lines of "none are known at this time".
